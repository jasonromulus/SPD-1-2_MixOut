MixOut is a social media & events website designed to get people out of their comfort zone and meet new people.

## How it Works
1. User visits our website
1. User is introduced conceptually to our vision with the homepage
1. User fills out a brief survey
1. User is shown matching events near them
  - these events have users with similar survey results
1. User goes out to the event and meets new people
